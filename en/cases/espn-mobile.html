        <h2>How we developed ESPN Brasil's mobile portal in 3 weeks.</h2>
        <p>Every week we deployed new features to production. There has been a couple of partners
        in the IT community helping ESPN maintain the fast-paced editorial rhythm and HE:labs is
        one of these companies.</p>

            <span>One of our big specialties is integrating systems. </span>When ESPN Brazil, a giant in
            sports journalism, approached us to build their first mobile portal, it was a
            a huge chance to write some history. We ended up developing and integrating an entirely new mobile application within their existing CMS system in record time.

              Already on the first week's iteration, we created a functional version of the site
              and developed a web service to exchange information, like data and files, between
              the different systems.

          <p>The web service also had a great benefit: it ended up turning into a commercial solution
          for distributing content to other devices, like smart-TVs.</p>

          <p>We had also considered adding responsive design to automatically adjust the different media formats like text, audio, image or video.</p>

          <p>So what's the net gain for contracting an agile team?</p>
          <p>For this project, continuous improvement and self-organization between the team helped optimize time and anticipate product vision and features. For example: on the next iteration, we already had planned to support Firefox OS, and responsive design.</p>
