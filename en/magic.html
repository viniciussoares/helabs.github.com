            <h4>Client ideation</h4>
            For the first time we meet, both client and team speak about the project's short
            and long term vision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireframe sketching</h4>
            Client and team sketch each page as they imagine it developed.

              <a class="show-more" title="Learn more about wireframe sketching"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></a>
              <div class="show-content">
                <p>The objective of this stage is to extract everyone's main ideas (client's and team's) and, by communicating via the illustrations, agree on what needs to get done.</p>
                <p>When we speak of wireframe sketching, we literally mean a drawing of what you imagine your interface to be. Simple pen and paper drawing. <a href="/pdfs/exemplo-de-desenho.pdf" target="_blank" data-no-instant>Check out an example!</a></p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong> Everyone from our team and the client makes individual sketches of the interface as they imagine;</p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> The sketches should reflect the application's flow. How users should interact with the application, which elements must exist and things of this nature;</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> Everyone presents their sketch and there's a discussion regarding the best components;</p>
                  <p><strong>4.</strong> Creation of a final sketch, which becomes the delivery for the next phase.</p>

            <h4>Breaking stories into tasks and estimating</h4>
            The team dissolves the final sketch into design and programming tasks, where each team member attributes his or her own estimate.

                <p>The main objective here is to find out what and how much effort is necessary for your development.</p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong> After the team discusses the sketches, we create a step-by-step walkthrough for each sketched screen. We call these user stories, where inside each, there are a bunch of tasks;</p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> At our workplace, we use boards to either list out or draw all of the necessary components to bring each sketch (data models, etc.) to life;</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> Each task has X points. Everyone on the team estimates how many points they think the task is worth;</p>
                  <p><strong>4.</strong> The point system used is 1, 2, 4 or 8, which represents the team's effort in relation to a user story;</p>

          <h4>Prioritizing the tasks</h4>
            Client prioritizes the tasks to be executed for the week.

              <div class="show-content">
                <p>After knowing the effort for each task, it's time to prioritize them and define which are the most important to get done for the week.</p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong> Client re-arranges the tasks in order of importantance, regardless of effort;</p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> The team helps the client to prioritize, pointing out any complexities of each task at hand;</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> Client prioritizes an average of 30 points per person on the team. For example: a team with 2 people would deliver approximately 60 points;</p>
                  <p><strong>4.</strong> At the end of priotization, client and team agree on the scope for that week;</p>

                <p>All projects have a testing environment, called staging. Staging works online so that client and team can execute tests somewhere as similar as possible to what's on production.</p>
                <div class="modalEntry">
                  <p><strong>1.</strong> The staging environment is secured with login credentials so that only those with access rights may enter;</p>

                <p>The team utilizes a range of best practices: automated-testing, 100% line coverage and continuous integration.</p>

                  <p><strong>1.</strong> Each line of code has been executed at least once in order to guarantee its functionality. This way, new functionalities do not affect old ones;</p>
                  <p><strong>2.</strong> We have to test everything! After this, we guarantee 100% we'll cover your tests. In other words, there won't be one single line of code that has not been tested;</p>
                  <p><strong>3.</strong> Every small portion of written code is sent to staging, a process that happens multiple times per day, guaranteeing there are no surprises on your production environment.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>Internal and Open Source projects</h4>
            While the client is QAing the system, the team takes the opportunity to work on internal company projects, like contributing to <a href="/en/opensource/">open source</a> projects, writing <a href="http://helabs.com.br/blog/" data-no-instant>blog</a> posts, as well as workshops and other forms of technical improvement.
