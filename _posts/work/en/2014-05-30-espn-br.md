about: Development of ESPN Brasil's online portal and one of Brazil's biggest cable television sports channel. With a responsive version, it solved several problems for mobile users, as they couldn't access the portal from their devices.

status: Project is live and being used by sports fans, breaking audience records in the first month after launch.

what_has_been_done: Being the great portal that it is, the idea was to replace pages one by one so users wouldn't feel the change. The portal today has 100% support for mobile devices.
